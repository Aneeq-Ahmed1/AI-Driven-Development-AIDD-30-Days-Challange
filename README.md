# 🤖 AI-Driven Development (AIDD) 30-Day Challenge

Welcome to my journey through the **AI-Driven Development (AIDD) 30-Day Challenge**! This repository documents my reflections, learnings, and progress as I explored the future of software development in the **AI-Native Era**.

---

## 📅 Challenge Overview

- **Duration:** 30 Days  
- **Focus:** Understanding how AI and human creativity combine to create a new AI-Native Era  
- **Instructor:** Sir Hamzah Syed  
- **Goal:** Explore how developers are evolving from traditional coders to AI collaborators.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Learn the concept of **AI-Driven Development (AIDD)** and its impact on software development.  
2. Understand the **October 2025 AI Turning Point** and why it was a global milestone.  
3. Explore **Evaluation-Driven Development (EvDD)** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in AI workflows.  
4. Track personal learning and growth throughout the 30-day challenge.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **AI Turning Point (Oct 2025)** | When AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude made AI-assisted development mainstream. |
| **Agentic AI** | AI systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously. |
| **Evaluation-Driven Development (EvDD)** | Development style that evaluates and improves AI-generated outputs. |
| **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** | Classic testing-first approach — still key in AI workflows. |
| **AI Productivity Boom** | Developer productivity increased 5–10× through AI coding agents. |

# Task 7 -- SPECKit Plus (RADMED Version)

## What is SPECKit Plus?

SPECKit Plus is an AI‑driven framework that structures a complete
software development lifecycle. It helps developers define the vision,
specify requirements, create plans, divide work into tasks, and
implement solutions efficiently and consistently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1️⃣ Constitution Phase

The Constitution Phase defines the project's core purpose, vision,
scope, values, and constraints. It aligns all team members and AI agents
on *why* the project exists and what success looks like.

## 2️⃣ Specify Phase

The Specify Phase converts the vision into detailed, clear, and testable
requirements. This includes user stories, acceptance criteria, system
behaviors, and stakeholder needs.

## 3️⃣ Plan Phase

The Plan Phase builds the execution roadmap. It outlines milestones,
workflows, risks, dependencies, and resource allocation to ensure
predictable development.

## 4️⃣ Tasks Phase

The Tasks Phase breaks down the plan into small, actionable tasks. Every
task includes instructions, outputs, tools, and the responsible agent to
ensure smooth parallel work.

## 5️⃣ Implement Phase

The Implement Phase is where development happens. AI agents and
developers write code, test features, integrate systems, and deliver
working components based on previous phases.

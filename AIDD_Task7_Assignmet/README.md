🌐 Task 7 – SPECKit Plus
AI-Driven Development – 30-Day Challenge
📌 What is SPECKit Plus?

SPECKit Plus is an AI-driven project development framework developed by Sir Zia’s team.
It helps teams build software in a structured, predictable, and efficient way.

SPECKit Plus guides developers through:

Defining the project vision

Specifying clear requirements

Planning the execution strategy

Breaking the work into manageable tasks

Implementing the final solution

This framework ensures clarity, reduces confusion, and improves collaboration between developers and AI agents.

🧩 SPECKit Plus – 5 Core Concepts
1️⃣ Constitution Phase

The Constitution Phase establishes the foundation of the entire project.
It defines:

Project purpose

Mission

Scope

Goals

Values

Constraints

Success criteria

This phase ensures everyone understands why the project exists before development begins.

2️⃣ Specify Phase

The Specify Phase converts the project vision into clear, detailed, and testable requirements.

This includes:

User stories

Acceptance criteria

Stakeholder identification

System behaviors

The outcome: Developers and AI agents know exactly what needs to be built.

3️⃣ Plan Phase

The Plan Phase outlines the execution roadmap, including:

Milestones

Workflows

Timelines

Risks

Dependencies

This structured plan ensures smooth, predictable, and well-organized progress.

4️⃣ Tasks Phase

In the Tasks Phase, the plan is broken into small, actionable tasks.

Each task contains:

Clear instructions

Expected outputs

Required tools

Assigned responsibility

This phase enables efficient parallel development and reduces bottlenecks.

5️⃣ Implement Phase

The Implement Phase is where actual development happens.

Here, developers and AI agents:

Build features

Test functionality

Integrate components

Deliver working solutions

The focus is on quality, consistency, and continuous improvement.

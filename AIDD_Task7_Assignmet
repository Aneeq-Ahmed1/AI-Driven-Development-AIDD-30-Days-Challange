📌 What is SPECKit Plus?

SPECKit Plus is an AI-driven project development framework that helps teams build software in a structured, predictable, and efficient way. It guides developers through defining the project vision, specifying requirements, planning execution, breaking down tasks, and implementing the final solution. It ensures clarity, reduces confusion, and improves collaboration between developers and AI agents.

🧩 SPECKit Plus – 5 Core Concepts
1️⃣ Constitution Phase

The Constitution Phase establishes the foundation of the entire project. It defines the project’s purpose, mission, scope, goals, values, constraints, and success criteria. This phase ensures everyone understands why the project exists before development begins.

2️⃣ Specify Phase

The Specify Phase transforms the project vision into detailed, clear, and testable requirements. This includes defining user stories, acceptance criteria, stakeholders, and system behaviors. It ensures developers and AI agents know exactly what needs to be built.

3️⃣ Plan Phase

The Plan Phase outlines the execution strategy. It includes milestones, workflows, timelines, risks, and dependency mapping. This step turns requirements into a structured development roadmap, ensuring smooth and predictable progress.

4️⃣ Tasks Phase

In the Tasks Phase, the work is broken into small, independent, and actionable tasks. Each task includes instructions, expected outputs, tools, and assigned responsibilities. This allows for efficient parallel development and reduces bottlenecks.

5️⃣ Implement Phase

The Implement Phase is where actual development happens. Developers and AI agents build features, test components, integrate systems, and deliver working outputs based on the tasks defined earlier. This phase focuses on quality delivery and continuous improvement.
